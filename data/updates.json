I expect to have to patch this over the next hour or so. \n PLEASE NOTE: For those of you that have notced the site's data not loading sometimes, know that I've seen this issue. I've had to set the server's log setting to ERROR, since I accidentally left it on DEBUG. I would scroll through, but it's 300,000 lines long. I will be starting over, and checking if the errors present themselves. \n Also added a wind chill calculator. PLEASE NOTE that I've had to do conversion between Farenheit and Celsius (both ways) to do this formula, as well as mph to knots. Due to the lack of debate on these formulae, it should be fine. Code available online."
