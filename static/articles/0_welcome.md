# Hello.
Recently I realised I spent an exorbitant amount of my life staring at the United States' National Weather Service website. I feel I have a very good handle on weather, and an ability to communicate this information. Therefore, I have turned back the clock to 2011, and have started a blog.

This is the Weather Update. Name work in progress.

To test this mechanic, I am uploading an image of the weather forecast for the New York City metropolitan area for the Friday, Feb 27 2026.

A quick note here is that NWS Products are in the [public domain.](https://www.weather.gov/disclaimer)

Will post sometime in the next 7 days.
